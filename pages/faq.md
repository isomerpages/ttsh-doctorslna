It is best to discuss with your team about where they should be focusing their learning before the LNA submission. When someone in your team completed their LNA submission, and email will be auto-routed for your attention. If you do not agree with their submission, do email <u>Prof Michelle Jong</u> before the deadlinne so we can rectify. 

10. **How will I know my submission is successful OR which course(s) is approved?** 
Your HOD will be notified by HRPD in due course, roughly Jan-Mar the following year.
